## Requirements
Python 2
SimpleCV/OpenCV (not entirely sure which one)
Up until now, have only had luck running this on Windows

## What Does This Do?
These two codes are really useful for organizing images of micro-well plates taken with a macroscope by the barcode printed onto them. 

*OrganizeAssayPhotographsByBarcode.py* organizes pictures of optically clear micro-well plates taken from the top with the barcode label affixed to the top surface of the plate

*OrganizeStoragePlatesByBarcode.py* organizes pictures of polypropylene micro-well storage plates with the barcode on the side, and viewed from the bottom with the barcode imaged through a 45Ëš mirror.
